# Labor-Optimization-at-Production-Department
project.excel: The pricriptive model and solution 
The optimization model presented is to identify which plan of two labor plans cost less at an engineering company.
Problem
With too few materials arriving, the assemblers help other departments or just do nothing, but they still get paid for the hours in the office. However, with lots of materials arriving, the assemblers need to work overtime, and the overtime rate is much higher than the original working hour rate. The manager of the assembling department wants to hire another assembler to reduce some workload without increasing costs. So the question is whether the cost of hiring 6 assemblers will be higher, compared with the cost of hiring 5 assemblers. If the companyâ€™s business goes down or up, the supply quantity would change with it. If the quantity of materials supplied every week changes, what will it impact on the total labor costs?
Proposed Solution
If we find out that hiring 6 assemblers costs less than hiring 5 assemblers, the company will not save any dollar, but capacity will be increased a lot. Through prescriptive analytics, and exclusive access to the data we will build out a model that will act as a proof of concept. The model will help the company to make the right decision according to their requirements.
